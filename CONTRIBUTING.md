# Contributing to Deondocs

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Deondocs! We welcome contributions from the community to help improve our documentation. This guide will help you understand how to contribute by editing and adding content to our documentation pages. This documentation uses Fumadocs. Fumadocs is a documentation framework based on Next.js, designed to be fast and flexible. Thanks to [fuma-nama](https://github.com/fuma-nama).

1. **Browse the Documentation**: Explore the existing documentation at [deonhub](https://www.deonhub.tz/docs).
2. **Identify Areas for Improvement**: Look for unclear explanations, outdated information, missing content, typos, or opportunities to add examples.
3. **Fork the Repository**: Fork the Deondocs repository on GitHub.
4. **Create a Branch**: Create a new branch for your changes.
5. **Make Your Changes**: Edit the relevant Markdown (.mdx) files in the `content/docs/` directory
6. **Commit Your Changes**: Make commits with clear messages.
7. **Push Your Changes**: Push to your fork on GitHub.
8. **Create a Pull Request**: Create a pull request to the `dev` branch of the Deondocs repository

## Review Process

After submitting a pull request:

1. Automated checks will run to ensure the content meets our standards
2. A maintainer will review your changes
3. They may ask for revisions or clarifications
4. Once approved, your changes will be merged into the main branch
5. After merging, an automated process will sync the changes to our main documentation site

We aim to review all pull requests within 5 business days.
